## Objective

Analyze a phishing email with a malicious .hta (HTML application) attachment, investigate its impact, and track its progression, including bypassing User Account Control (UAC), credential harvesting, and lateral movement to the Domain Controller.

### Skills Learned

- Email Analysis
  - Inspecting and analyzing phishing emails and attachments for malicious behavior.
  - Identifying potential Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used in spear-phishing attacks. 
- Artifact Analysis
  - Understanding .hta files and their potential to execute malicious scripts.
  - Investigating payloads (.dat files) retrieved via Command and Control (C2) channels.  
- Advanced Threat Hunting
  - Tracking lateral movement within a network.
  - Identifying credential harvesting activities and their impact on enterprise security.  
- Log Analysis and Visualization
  - Using Elastic Search and Kibana for searching, correlating, and visualizing security events.
  - Extracting and interpreting critical artifacts from security logs.

### Tools Used

- Email Analysis
  - Email client for inspecting headers, attachments, and metadata.
- Artifact Analysis
  - Manual inspection of .hta files and .dat payloads.
  - Basic scripting and reverse engineering tools (if needed).
- Log Analysis and Visualization
  - Elastic Search: Searchable repository for security logs.
  - Kibana: Visualization tool for analyzing and visualizing log data.

## Outcome

- Email Analysis
  - Successfully identified the .hta attachment as the initial vector of compromise.  
- Artifact Analysis
  - Decoded the .dat payload and revealed its capabilities to bypass UAC, perform credential harvesting, and facilitate lateral movement.  
- Log Analysis and Threat Hunting
  - Used Elastic Search and Kibana to trace lateral movement from the initial access point to the Domain Controller.
  - Identified compromised credentials and critical data access events.
- Incident Assessment
  - Delivered a detailed assessment of the attackâ€™s progression and impact.
  - Recommended measures to strengthen defenses against similar attacks in the future.
